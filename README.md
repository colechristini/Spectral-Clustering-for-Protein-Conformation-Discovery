# Spectral Clustering for Protein Conformation Discovery
Scripts used for various steps (including data processing and generation of some figures) for the poster 'Spectral Clustering for Protein Conformation Discovery' presented at the Carnegie Mellon Computer Science Department Independent Research Symposium in Fall 2023.

These scripts are generally intended for use only in this project but should generally be easily adaptable to apply the methods to other data. Figure 3 was created by hand using VMD.
